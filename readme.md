# üöÄ Terraform Plan Diff Action: `tf-plan-diff`

Welcome to the **tf-plan-diff** action! This lightweight GitHub Action allows you to create a neat and readable diff of your Terraform plan JSON files, making it easier to visualize what changes will happen in your infrastructure. üéâ

## ‚ú® Features

- **Fast and Lightweight**: Built in Go and uses precompiled binaries for speedy execution.
- **Readable Output**: See exactly what will be created, modified, or destroyed in a clear diff format.
- **Flexible Options**: Customize your output based on what you want to see!

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

Simply pass your Terraform plan JSON file to this action, and it will output the changes in a beautiful diff format like this:

# `webhook-lambda` Plan Diff :building_construction:

```diff
- module.dynamodb_table.aws_dynamodb_table.table will be deleted
- module.github_PAT_secret.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.this will be deleted
! aws_iam_policy.secret_access will be updated
! aws_iam_role.lambda_execution will be updated
+ module.github_PAT_secret.aws_secretsmanager_secret.this will be created
+ module.github_webhook_secret.aws_secretsmanager_secret.this will be created
+ module.github_webhook_secret.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.this will be created
! aws_iam_policy.lambda_dynamodb_write_policy will be recreated
! aws_lambda_function.webhook will be recreated
```
